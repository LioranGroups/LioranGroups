        Lioran Groups offers a limited 24-hour refund policy on eligible paid
        products and plans, unless otherwise stated.
      </p>

      <p className="text-slate-300">
        A full refund may be requested within 24 hours of purchase, provided the
        product or service has not been excessively used or consumed beyond a
        reasonable usage limit.
      </p>

      <p className="text-slate-300">
        Usage beyond a defined percentage of the plan, quota, or service capacity
        may make the purchase ineligible for a refund. This is to prevent misuse
        of paid resources.
      </p>

      <p className="text-slate-300">
        Certain products, including R&D tools, early-access offerings, or
        customized services, may not be eligible for refunds. Such exclusions
        will be clearly communicated at the time of purchase.

        Refund eligibility is evaluated on a case-by-case basis and final
